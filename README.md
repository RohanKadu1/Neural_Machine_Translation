# French to English Machine Translation

## Overview

This project presents a machine translation model that translates French sentences into English. It offers two distinct approaches: one developed with Keras for sequence-to-sequence modeling and the other utilizing the Transformers library for state-of-the-art machine translation. The project includes data preprocessing, tokenization, model training, evaluation, and comparison of translations between the custom Keras model and the Transformers-based model. This README provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the code interactively)
- Required Python packages, which can be installed via pip:

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/french-to-english-translation.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd french-to-english-translation

3. Download the French-English translation dataset and unzip it:

!curl -o fra-eng.zip http://www.manythings.org/anki/fra-eng.zip

4. Install the necessary Python packages by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Model Comparison

The project includes a comparison of translations generated by the custom Keras model and the Transformers-based model. The `Model Comparison` section of the notebooks presents a side-by-side evaluation of the two models' performance.

## Results

The project evaluates the machine translation models and calculates the BLEU score to assess their translation quality. The results are displayed in the notebooks.
